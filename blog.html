            Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables,
              but they have different scopes and behaviors. Understanding their
              scope is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. <br />
              <br />
              <b>var:</b><br />

              <b>Function Scope:</b> Variables declared with var are
              function-scoped. This means they are visible throughout the entire
              function in which they are defined. <br />
              <b>Hoisting:</b> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the
              top of their containing function or global scope. This means you
              can use a var variable before it's declared in your code, but it
              will be initialized with undefined. <br />
              <b>Re-declaration:</b> You can re-declare a var variable within
              the same scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>let:</b> <br />

              <b>Block Scope:</b> Variables declared with let are block-scoped,
              which means they are only accessible within the block (i.e.,
              between curly braces) in which they are defined. This includes
              loops, conditional statements, and functions. <br />
              <b>No Hoisting:</b> Variables declared with let are not hoisted to
              the top of their containing block, so you can't use them before
              they are declared. <br />
              <b>No Re-declaration:</b> You cannot re-declare a let variable in
              the same block scope. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax
              error. <br />
              <br />
              <b>const:</b> <br />

              <b>Block Scope:</b> Like let, const is block-scoped. <br />
              <b>No Hoisting:</b> const variables are not hoisted, so you can't
              use them before they are declared. <br />
              <b>Immutable:</b> Variables declared with const are constant and
              cannot be reassigned after they are initialized. However, the
              value they hold can still be modified if it's an object or an
              array. This means you cannot do const x = 10; x = 20;, but you can
              do const arr = [1, 2, 3]; arr.push(4);. <br /><br />
              In modern JavaScript, it's generally recommended to use let for
              most variables because of its block scope and avoidance of
              hoisting-related issues. Use const for variables that should not
              be re-assigned, and reserve var for situations where you
              specifically need function-scoped behavior (though this is
              becoming increasingly rare with ES6 and beyond). Properly scoping
              variables can help prevent bugs and make your code more
              predictable and maintainable.

          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              In JavaScript, null and undefined are both used to represent the
              absence of a value or the lack of a defined value. However, they
              are used in slightly different contexts and have different use
              cases. <br /><br />
              <b>undefined:</b> <br />

              <b>Default Value:</b> Variables that are declared but not
              initialized are automatically assigned the value undefined. This
              can be useful when you want to indicate that a variable exists but
              hasn't been given a value yet. <br />
              <b>Function Parameters:</b> If a function is called with fewer
              arguments than declared parameters, the missing parameters are
              assigned the value undefined. <br />
              <b>Missing Properties:</b> When you try to access an object
              property that doesn't exist, JavaScript returns undefined. <br />
              <br />
              <b>null:</b> <br />

              <b>Intentional Absence:</b> null is typically used when you want
              to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has no
              value or is intentionally empty. It is a deliberate assignment to
              represent a lack of data. <br />
              <b>Clearing Values:</b> You can assign null to a variable or
              object property to clear its value or indicate that it should no
              longer reference an object or value. <br />
              <b>Comparisons:</b> null can be used in comparisons to check for
              the absence of a value. <br />
              <br />
              In summary, undefined typically represents the absence of an
              expected value due to uninitialized variables, missing function
              arguments, or accessing non-existent object properties. On the
              other hand, null is used to deliberately indicate that a variable
              or object property has no value or to clear a value. Understanding
              the distinction between these two can help you write more
              expressive and bug-free JavaScript code.

            What do you mean by REST API?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>
              REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer
              Application Programming Interface, is a widely used architectural
              style for designing networked applications. It is not a specific
              technology or protocol but rather a set of constraints and
              principles for building web services. RESTful APIs are based on
              the principles of simplicity, scalability, and statelessness.
              <br />
              <br />

              Key characteristics and principles of RESTful APIs include: <br />
              <br />

              1. <b>Statelessness:</b> Each HTTP request to a REST API should
              contain all the information needed to understand and process the
              request. The server should not rely on any previous requests,
              which makes it easier to scale and distribute the API. <br />

              2. <b>Resources:</b> In REST, everything is treated as a resource,
              and each resource is uniquely identified by a Uniform Resource
              Identifier (URI). Resources can represent objects, data, or
              entities, and they are typically organized into a hierarchical
              structure. <br />

              3. <b>HTTP Methods:</b> REST APIs use standard HTTP methods to
              perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on
              resources. The most common HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:
              <br />
              - <b>GET:</b> Retrieve data from the server. <br />
              - <b>POST:</b> Create a new resource on the server. <br />
              - <b>PUT:</b> Update an existing resource or create it if it
              doesn't exist. <br />
              - <b>PATCH:</b> Partially update an existing resource. <br />
              - <b>DELETE:</b> Remove a resource from the server. <br />

              4. <b>Uniform Interface:</b> A RESTful API should have a
              consistent and well-defined interface. This includes using
              standard HTTP methods, clear resource naming conventions (e.g.,
              nouns for resource names), and a predictable structure for URIs.
              <br />

              5. <b>Representation:</b> Resources can have multiple
              representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients can request
              the representation they prefer using the `Accept` header in the
              HTTP request. Servers should respond with the appropriate
              representation. <br />

              6. <b>Stateless Communication:</b> The client and server
              communicate in a stateless manner, meaning that each request from
              the client to the server must include all the necessary
              information. There should be no reliance on session state being
              stored on the server. <br />

              7. <b>Layered System:</b> REST allows for a layered architecture,
              where various components (e.g., load balancers, caches, security
              layers) can be added between the client and server without
              affecting the client's ability to access the resource. <br />

              8. <b>Status Codes:</b> HTTP status codes are used to indicate the
              outcome of a request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for resource not
              found, 500 for server error). <br />
              <br />

              RESTful APIs are commonly used for building web services that
              provide data and functionality over the internet. They are popular
              because of their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use by both
              humans and machines. Many web applications and mobile apps rely on
              REST APIs to retrieve and manipulate data from remote servers.
